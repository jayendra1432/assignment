    "#1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "#ANSWER:-In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. It takes the file path as a parameter and returns a file object that allows you to perform various operations on the file. The open() function can be used to open files in different modes. Here are the commonly used modes of file opening:\n",
    "\n",
    "#  'r' (Read Mode): This is the default mode for opening a file. It allows you to read the contents of a file. If the file does not exist, it raises a FileNotFoundError. \n",
    "\n",
    "        #Example: file = open('test.txt', 'r')\n",
    "\n",
    "#  'w' (Write Mode): This mode is used to write data into a file. If the file already exists, it will be truncated (emptied). If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. \n",
    "        #Example: file = open('test.txt', 'w')\n",
    "\n",
    "#  'a' (Append Mode): This mode is used to append data to an existing file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. \n",
    "        #Example: file = open('test.txt', 'a')\n",
    "\n",
    "#  'x' (Exclusive Creation Mode): This mode is used to create a new file, but it raises a FileExistsError if the file already exists. \n",
    "        #Example: file = open('test.txt', 'x')\n",
    "\n",
    "#  'b' (Binary Mode): This mode is used for binary file operations. It is used in conjunction with other modes, such as 'rb' (read binary) or 'wb' (write binary), to handle binary files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  't' (Text Mode): This mode is used for text file operations. It is the default mode and can be omitted. It is used in conjunction with other modes, such as 'rt' (read text) or 'wt' (write text), to handle text files.\n"

    "#Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "#ANSWER:-- The close() function is used to close a file that was previously opened using the open() function. It is important to close a file for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "    #1. Resource Management: When you open a file, the operating system allocates certain resources to handle the file operations. Closing the file releases these resources, such as memory and file descriptors, ensuring efficient resource management.\n",
    "    #2. Data Integrity: Closing a file ensures that all the data you wrote or read from the file is properly flushed and saved. If you do not close the file, some data may remain in the buffer and not be written to the file.\n",
    "    #3. Access by Other Programs: Closing a file makes it available for other programs or processes to access. Some operating systems restrict access to an open file, so closing it allows other programs to use or modify the file.\n",
    "    #4. File Corruption: In rare cases, not closing a file properly may lead to file corruption or data loss, especially if the file is being written or modified. Closing the file reduces the risk of such issues.\n",
    "    #5. It is good practice to always close the file after you have finished working with it to ensure proper resource management and data integrity."

It provides an advantage in terms of automatic resource management and exception handling. When you use the with statement with open(), you don't need to explicitly call the close() function to close the file. The with statement takes care of closing the file automatically when the code execution exits the block. This ensures that the file is always properly closed, even if an exception occurs within the block.\n",
