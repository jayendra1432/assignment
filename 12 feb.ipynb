    "#Q1.What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Answer:- An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. It is a way of handling errors or exceptional situations that may arise while the program is running. When an exception occurs, it generates an object known as an exception object that contains information about the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#The key differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Occurrence: Exceptions occur during the execution of the program when certain conditions or errors arise. Syntax errors occur during the parsing phase when the program is being compiled or interpreted.\n",
    "#2. Handling: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks. This allows you to gracefully handle errors and continue program execution. Syntax errors need to be fixed by correcting the code structure or syntax violations before the program can be executed.\n",
    "#3. Nature: Exceptions are runtime errors that occur due to specific conditions or situations while the program is running. Syntax errors are coding mistakes that violate the rules of the Python language's syntax and prevent the program from being compiled or interpreted."
