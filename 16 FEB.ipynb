    "#Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#ANSWER:--  #A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed in a structured manner. It provides a way to store, retrieve, update, and manage data efficiently. Databases can be broadly classified into two categories: SQL and NoSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "            #SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on a relational model and use structured schemas to define the data. They store data in tables with predefined columns and rows, and relationships between tables are established using keys. SQL databases ensure data integrity, support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, and provide a standardized query language (SQL) for accessing and manipulating data. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "            #NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, offer a flexible data model and do not rely on structured schemas. They can store unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large amounts of data with high scalability and performance. They are often used for handling dynamic, rapidly changing data and can be horizontally scaled across multiple servers. NoSQL databases come in various forms, including key-value stores, document databases, columnar databases, and graph databases. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Neo4j.\n",
    "\n",
    "            #The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the nature of the data, scalability needs, performance requirements, and the level of data consistency required."

    "#Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "#ANSWER:-   #1. Primary Key: A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. It ensures the integrity and uniqueness of the data. The primary key constraint prevents duplicate and null values in the key column(s). Typically, a primary key is chosen from existing candidate keys in a table. In relational databases, primary keys are used to establish relationships between tables through foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "            #2. Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It creates a relationship between two tables, allowing data in one table to reference data in another table. The foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity, meaning that the values in the foreign key column(s) must match values in the referenced primary key column(s) or be null. By using foreign keys, you can establish relationships and enforce data consistency across tables."
