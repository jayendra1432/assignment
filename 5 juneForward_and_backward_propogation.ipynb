    "1. Weights: Weights are associated with the connections between neurons in different layers of the network. Each neuron receives inputs from the previous layer, and these inputs are multiplied by corresponding weights. The weights determine the strength or importance of the connections between neurons. During forward propagation, the weighted inputs are summed, and the activation function is applied to produce the output of the neuron. By adjusting the weights, the network learns to assign the appropriate significance to different inputs, allowing it to capture complex patterns in the data.\n",

    "2. Biases: Biases are additional parameters added to each neuron. They provide an offset or a baseline value that can be added to the weighted sum of inputs. Biases allow neurons to output non-zero values even when all the inputs are zero. They introduce flexibility and enable the network to shift and adjust the decision boundaries. Similar to weights, biases are adjusted during training to optimize the network's performance.\n",

    "1. Vanishing or Exploding Gradients:\n",
    "   In deep neural networks, gradients can become extremely small (vanishing gradients) or extremely large (exploding gradients) as they propagate backward through many layers. This can hinder the learning process. To address this issue:\n",
    "   - Use activation functions that alleviate the vanishing gradient problem, such as ReLU or variants like Leaky ReLU.\n",

    "   - Use normalization techniques like batch normalization to stabilize the gradients.\n",

    "2. Unstable or Slow Convergence:\n",
    "   The learning process might be unstable, with slow convergence or erratic behavior. This can be due to a variety of factors:\n",
    "   - Check the learning rate. If it is too high, it may cause oscillations or overshooting. If it is too low, convergence can be slow. Adjust the learning rate accordingly.\n",

    "3. Incorrect Implementation of Gradients:\n",
    "   Mistakes in implementing the gradients during backward propagation can lead to incorrect updates of the parameters. To mitigate this issue:\n",
    "   - Double-check the mathematical calculations of gradients to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "   - Use automatic differentiation tools or established deep learning frameworks, which handle the gradient calculations internally.\n",
    "   - Validate the implementation by comparing the gradients with numerical approximations using techniques like gradient checking.\n",

    "   Backward propagation can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. To tackle overfitting:\n",
    "   - Increase the size of the training dataset if possible.\n",
    "   - Employ regularization techniques such as dropout, which randomly drops out some neurons during training, or early stopping, which stops training when the performance on a validation set starts deteriorating.\n",
    "   - Adjust the model architecture by reducing the number of parameters or introducing regularization layers like dropout or batch normalization.\n",

    "5. Computational Efficiency:\n",
    "   In large-scale networks or complex architectures, backward propagation can be computationally expensive. To improve efficiency:\n",
    "   - Utilize efficient implementations provided by deep learning libraries that leverage parallel computing (e.g., GPU acceleration).\n",
